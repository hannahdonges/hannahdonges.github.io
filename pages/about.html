                <h2>Hi there, I'm Hannah!</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently in my final year of studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Mechatronic Systems) at ANU, and work part-time in engineering support for a computer vision company. When I’m not busy on a new tech project or cramming for exams, in my free time (albeit limited) I love creating art in any and all possible forms. <br><br>
                    Here on my site you will find an eclectic assortment of past works including – but not limited to – painting, embroidery, metal casting and woodwork. I enjoy working with a large range of mediums as each requires a unique set of skills, techniques, and tools – presenting new challenges and allowing me to broaden my understanding of creating. <br><br>
                    Much of the inspiration for my works is drawn from the beauty of the world around me, including both natural forms and iconic man-made structures. Through my work, I wish to capture and express this in a way which may invoke a sense of wonder and inspire others to look more purposefully at world, so that they too may be inspired. I also enjoy working with movement and functionality within my designs to create items of use. <br><br>
                    My website is aimed at anyone interested in hand-crafted art, as well as those looking for inspiration to pick up a new hobby. If you like what you see and want to get in touch, contact me <a href="./contact.html">here</a>!
